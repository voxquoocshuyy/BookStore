# BookStore
## Welcome to my project repository. This repo code for selling books and managing books (same as tiki.vn). This is my coursework so there will be a lot of mistakes
### *_You will find in this repo the following stuff:_*

* .gitignore file itself to demonstrate how to ask the Git tool to upload a file or not
* README.md file itself to show the contrens of this repo. It acts a homepage of this repo
* The look and feel of a normal sales site and it has CRUD, shopping cart and checkout
